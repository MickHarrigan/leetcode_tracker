# LeetCode interactive library and tooling

This is a set of a library for interacting with [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) through the `lc_lib` crate.

This provides bindings that `lc_cli` and `lc_tui` then use to allow a user to interact with LeetCode in a few different ways.

## CLI
This is the primary way to interact with the library.
This gives a way to use a simple CLI interface to get questions, solve them, and then submit them from the terminal.

## TUI
This is the secondary way to interact with the library.
This gives a front end within a terminal that mimics a GUI and gives a more interactive approach to solving and reading about the problems that LeetCode has to solve.
