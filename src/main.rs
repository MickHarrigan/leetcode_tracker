/* This is a cli tool that creates a new leetcode 
 * entry within the `<...>/leetcode repo`.
 *
 * This tool is designed for my own personal use and not really intended for distribution.
 *
 * The goal with this is to make a real cli tool and to cargo install it so
 * I can just use it each day that I make a new LC solution.
 *
 * The longer term goal is to have a way to make this fetch my solutions and
 * information about my submissions, but that is after building this first.

/* Todo:
 * create usage with ./lc (or really lc when its done)
 * should be 3 modes of operation:
 *  1: without args then run through questions to fill in the necessary data
 *  2: with args that fill in the data
 *  3: <Later> a link to the problem that it fills in from
